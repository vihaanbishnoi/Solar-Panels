What is LEFT (in order of importance)
1️⃣ Explainability (Grad-CAM) ⭐
Show where the model looks on panels

Proves the model focuses on defects

Big boost for interviews & reports

2️⃣ Optional fine-tuning
Unfreeze last ResNet block

Train with lower learning rate

Improves subtle defect classes

3️⃣ Error analysis
Identify which classes are confused

Explain why (dust vs bird-drop, etc.)

Shows real ML thinking

4️⃣ Documentation
README:
